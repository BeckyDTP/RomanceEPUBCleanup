#Python EPUB cleanup
Hello! I am developing a Python script to clean up files that have been exported from a specific CMS. This solution is very specific to the files I am creating, but perhaps you will find something helpful in it. The goals are the following:

- Replace content in the OPF spine using regex
- Replace landmarks in the OPF spine using regex
- Replace content in the OPF metadata field and the NCX with content pulled from other files
